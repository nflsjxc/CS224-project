## Introduction

For our project we tried 3 different approaches: static analysis, learning-based analysis and LLM+prompt approach.

### Static approach: pythontyper

We utilizes and fuses the result of 2 existing tools: HiTyper and PyType. To run it, refer to `./pythontyper/README_static.md`

### Learning-based approach: type4py++

This tool is developed based on type4py, hence we name it type4py++. To run it, refer to `./type4py++/README_type4py++.md`

### LLM approach: TypeGen

We also conducted researches on LLM+prompt engineering based on TypeGen.  To run it, refer to `./TypeGen`
